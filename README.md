# EDEngineer

EDEngineer is a basic app I've written to track materials, data and cargo acquired in Elite Dangerous. That way, we can also track progress of blueprints available from the Engineers.

### Features

1. A transparent overlay that runs continuously and updates in real time what your ship holds (based on logs outputted by the game)
2. Show/Hide the overlay based on a global shortcut (default is Control + F10)
2. A tray icon where you can configure the shortcut and exit the overlay
3. All blueprints available in a handy sortable grid which you can filter too
4. Ignore/Favorite flags - Favorited blueprints that become available to craft trigger a Windows toast
